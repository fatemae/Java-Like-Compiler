I have completed my project for including the functionality of classes in lexing, parsing and typechecking phases of compiler.

The functionality of Classes that I have included are as follows :
-Variable and Functions should be enclosed in a Class like java
-Variable should be defined before functions in classes.
-I have included the functionality to typecheck the arguments of function during call
-Functions will always have a return type.
-Check for the type of returned value and returntype of function.
-Constructors can be created in classes.
-Constructors can be overloaded
-Can create objects of predefined class in a file.
-Check for correspoding object constructor during object creation.
-Access the global variable of a class using its object(Checks variable type)
-Access to functions of a class using its object(checks function arg and return type) 

I have added some testcases to test these functionality
